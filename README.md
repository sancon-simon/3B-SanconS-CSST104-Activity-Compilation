**Activity 1**

This activity is focused on the Introduction of Advance Machine Learning, the dataset that was used is "hardwarestore.csv" this contains the following;

CATEGORY_NAME, 
Category_ID, 
Product_ID, 
STANDARD_COST, 
LIST_PRICE, 
REGION_ID, 
LOCATION_ID, 
WAREHOUSE_ID, 
QUANTITY

The Activity is Composed of basic data loading, data initial analysis, category analysis, cost and price analysis, location analysis as well as producing reports and insights.

**Activity 2**

This activity encompasses the fitting of simple linear regression model and visualizing the correlation linearity, the dataset that was used is called "Lesson_4_grades_dataset.csv"

In this activity the students(us) performed grouping crucial columns to select important features for fitting the model, The activity also includes visualizing data linearity, preparing data for modeling, fitting the linear regression model, getting the model coeficients, and visualizing the linear regression line.

**Activity 3**

In the third acticity the students(us) tackled multiple linear regression, the dataset that was used is similar to the one that was used in the previous activity the "Lesson_4_student_grades_dataset.csv", in here we performed feature selection using droping method, from there the dataset was split, to be prepared for initialization of the model.

After the inizialization, the linear regression was fitted, made predictions and evaluate it using MSE, The activity 3 is focused on predicting the grade of the student based on multiple numerical variables.

**Activity 4**
